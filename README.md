# Tuya Window Shade
1. Please setup limits of both ends <b>BEFORE</b> pairing to your Smarttings Hub
2. You can setup forward/reverse and fixpercent option in the Smartthings device controller. 
3. Setup forward/reverse first. If the curtain motor is closing when you send 'open' command from app, then set this option to 'Reverse'.
   <b>You should use 'open'/'close' command by pressing GEAR SHAPED ICON for setting forward/reverse option</b>. DO NOT use % slide bar to 'open' or 'close' the curtain.
4. Set 'Fix percent' option unless open is 100% and close is 0%. In Smartthings, 'Open' should be 100% in level and 'Close' should be 0% in level. If it is reversed, then turn on 'Fix percent' option.
